**How to Set Up a React App with Vite Build Tool and PNPM Package Manager?**

In this tutorial, we'll walk through the steps to set up a React application using Vite as the build tool and PNPM as the package manager.

## **Prerequisites**

- Ensure you have Node.js installed. If not, [download it here](https://nodejs.org/en) (LTS recommended).
- For Windows users, install PNPM using PowerShell. Other OS installation instructions can be found [here](https://pnpm.io/installation).

### Step 1: Installing Node.js

- **Download Node.js**: Visit [Node.js official website](https://nodejs.org/en) and download the LTS version.
- **Install Node.js**: Follow the installation instructions for your operating system.
- **Verify Node.js Installation**: Open a terminal or command prompt and run `node -v` to check the installed Node.js version.

### Step 2: Installing PNPM

For Windows users:

- **Open PowerShell**: Launch PowerShell as an administrator.
- **Run PNPM Installation Script**: Copy and paste the following command and hit Enter.

```powershell
iwr https://get.pnpm.io/install.ps1 -useb | iex
```

- **Verification**: Once the installation is complete, verify PNPM installation by running `pnpm -v` in the PowerShell.

For other operating systems, refer to the [official PNPM installation guide](https://pnpm.io/installation) for detailed instructions.

### Step 3: Creating a React App with Vite

- **Create Project Folder**: Open your terminal and create a folder for the project.
- **Access Terminal in the Project Folder**: Navigate to the project folder using the terminal.
- **Initialize React App**: Type `pnpm create vite` and press Enter.
- **Enter Project Name**: Provide a name for your project when prompted (refer to the screenshot for guidance).
